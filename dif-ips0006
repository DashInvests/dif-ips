DIF Official Communication Channels

Any information agreed to between supervisors is on Github.

Any official information meant to represent DIF communication should be pointed to all supervisor approved reports on github.

Official DIF accounts should only point to approved (ie. a pull request has been approved by all Supervisors.) report.

ALL official account updates (Twitter or any other social media) MUST point to updates agreed to by all in writing via github
AND ON GITHUB. 

Each supervisor is entitled to their own opinion, on their own private accounts and can post anywhere they wish under their 
private handle.  

DIF communication MUST be agreed to by all via Github.  

Write a report, submit a pull request and get it approved by all supervisors and then point the Official account to the
Github Report or offical website report.
