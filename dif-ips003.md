# Advisor 

* Make investment advisor positions percentage based instead of an ongoing cost, paid out quarterly.      

* DIF can have multiple advisors that each get allocated a certain percentage of the funds to prove their plan/trading strategy works publicly.

* Advisors should be tasked with finding deals and sharing information about said deals with Supervisors.

* DIF should attempt to work with multiple advisors. Let the advisors work on the deal flow.


# Pay
* Merit based Pay: any deal that comes in through the advisors and is approved by Supervisor majority, gets a pre agreed upon percentage of the deal
as a finders fee.   

* If utilizing trading strategies, advisors get a percentage of net profits.

* No monthly expenses, each advisor gets paid based on market beating returns.


* I think it makes more sense to open the field to advisors on a beat the crypto market basis.

I believe that this general structure will be the most efficient for the DIF.
