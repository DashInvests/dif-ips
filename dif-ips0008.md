# Open Source Legal Documents For the Benefit of Open Source Community.

Any money DIF spends on legal we should aim to make the structure of the contracts and/or legal documents open source so 
that other Orgs that get funded through the Dash DAO can use the documents without having to go through the same level of 
expense for each Dash Funded Organizations (DFO).  we can save our legal costs across the DAO, pay once, use forever 
across multiple orgs.
