DIF Supervisors are accountable and electable by the network/MNO.

In the spirit of Opensource and open finance

All DIF documentation (Manual) and votes that involve money expenditure by the DIF for anything other than routine
expenditures, should go through public/transparent communication channels such as GitHub accompanied by 
a transparent Supervisor vote. 

All decisions should be traceable to a discussion on Github and subsequent written approval by DIF Supervisors.
