Thinking about GitHub I was wondering which public branches we would really need. 

Here are my suggestions: 


**1. Proposals**

*In this repo we can discuss upcoming proposals. It was already created. I like it.


**2. Investments + /inquiries + /done**

*incoming inquiries/ Here we could add all inquiries we received from the outside after getting a confirmation from the company/person who reached out to us. A perfect place to discuss and show the network the individual decisions of each supervisor

*outgoing inquiries/ Her we could add all inquiries made by supervisors and our advisor to discuss them.

*done/ a list of all investments made


**3. Strategy + /rebalancing + /investment**

*rebalancing/ the perfect place to show the rebalancing strategy. Of course the execution of it should be documented under 2. Investments/done

*investment/ contains a list of metrics on which we are deciding on investment. A public discussion for this might be usefull for MNOs


**4. Accounts**

*list of all exchange accounts including the discussion and responsibilities


**5.Accounting**

*listing aof all our savings


**6.Meeting Minutes**

*meeting minutes including not only the eganeda but also the outcome of the discussions and potential updates and to dos. the todos should be assigned to the responsable persons in the specific repos, too

What do you THink?
