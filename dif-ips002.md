# Move dashinvests.org website to Github Pages and host it on here. 

I would like to see if we can create a process for emails for investments that come in to hello@dashinvests to get placed in a repository to be tracked
and voted on by Supervisors.

# Reason:

The amount of automation that can be done via github is too much to enumerate.
