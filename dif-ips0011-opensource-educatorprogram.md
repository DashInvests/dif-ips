# Dash Open Source Educator Stipend Program

The best way for an organization to advance is to consistently attract people as smart or smarter than yourself.  Throughtout the crypto bear market it was obvious
the MNO are the hodlers of last resort.  A very small percentage of MN were liquidated even after a brutal bear.  To me that says that the incentives align and MN
are "sticky"...  ie. once a MN, usually stays a MN for a rather long time (multiple years in crypto is a lifetime)....  

MN stick around for the APR.  But, so far there exist only an activist/vocal few...


I believe we should find a way to incentivize independent masternode ownership for thought leaders. 

We should nominate people that we would like to see amongst the ranks of the owners of this network.


# Proposal idea: DIF handles contacting/building relationships with thought leaders (best in class) in Linux Tech and donates 1 MN worth of income for 1 year or more
for each winner/candidate (ideally i would like to make them MNO over a certain period of time, years possible).  

This would be similar in a manner to creating alumni.

Throughout the stipend period we educate the Educator about the Dash network governance, MN ownership benefits, features, etc.  

We gather their ideas on trends in the tech field and mix ideas.

This process would help build out the dev community as well garnering grassroots support from tech savvy individuals plus it highlights Dash's unique structure....

My initial nominees/candidates would be:

1) Luke Smith

2) DistroTube

3) LearnLinuxtv

As an example upon acceptance, the DIF could put a proposal to the DAO in the candidates name and their corresponding Dash address.

Note: i think we should have a program like this for independent news personalities...
