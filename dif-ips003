How about we make these investment advisor positions percentage based instead of an ongoing cost, paid out quarterly.      

We can have multiple advisors that each get allocated a certain percentage of the funds to prove their plan/trading strategy works.

Extra role for Advisors: should be tasked with finding deals and sharing information about said deals with Supervisors.

Don't be stuck with one advisor.  Let the advisors work on the deal flow.

Merit based Pay: any deal that comes in through the advisors and is approved by Supervisor majority, gets a pre agreed upon percentage of the deal
as a finders fee.   

If utilizing trading strategies, advisors get a percentage of net profits.

No monthly expenses, each advisor gets paid based on market beating returns.


I think it makes more sense to open the field to advisors on a beat the crypto market basis.

I believe that advisors confident in their abilities will easily take this kind of deal and its a better deal for the DIF.
