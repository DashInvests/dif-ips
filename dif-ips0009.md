# Outside collaborators (MNO) can use DIF-IPS as a way to communicate with the DIF and/or the Dash network on behalf of DIF

Any outside teams/collaborators can collaborate openly for free with the DIF via github.

As a mechanism to draw MNO attention to any action of the DIF,

If an outside party wants to submit an idea on governance to the DIF and wants to incorporate/approve the Change into the DIF
via a MNO vote, the user can submit a DIF-IPS and collaborate with DIF supervisors openly

and/or

spend the 5 Dash to submit their Github DIF-IPS proposal for a vote to the Dash DAO. 

The DIF will publicly reply to any such proposal on github for on the record response.  
DIF will not be legally obligated to incorporate change if not possible, 
but non implementation should be public with a reason why and voted upon publicly by supervisors.

The key here is tying a decision with tracaeble discussion on github with the Dash DAO.

For any such implementation to happen, there MUST BE an actionable item, not just a complaint.

For it to be actionable it must have some thought and discussion and laid out in a format that assigns action in detailed steps.
